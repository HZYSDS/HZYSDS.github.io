        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a final-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) student at the University of Technology Sydney, jointly enrolled at Northeastern University in China. 
        My academic journey spans artificial intelligence, deep learning, and computer vision, with a strong research focus on multimodal learning, infrared image segmentation, and zero-shot classification.</p>
        
        <p>I have led projects integrating high-precision thermal sensing (e.g., FLIR FC-608O) with AI models such as Segment Anything and Comparative CLIP. 
        Through both industry internships and university research labs, I’ve cultivated skills in real-time image processing, model optimization, and ethical system design.</p>
