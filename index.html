        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a final-year Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) student at UTS, majoring in Software Engineering. My passion lies in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and software development, with a strong focus on applying AI to real-world challenges.</p>
        
        
        <p>Throughout my university journey, I have engaged in research and projects that integrate deep learning, neural networks, and advanced software engineering principles. I have worked on brain-inspired AI models, object detection, and intelligent video analysis, contributing to both academic research and practical applications. My recent work involves developing a high-precision long-range infrared monitoring system for pedestrian and vehicle detection, as well as real-time image segmentation.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I have experience in industry projects and collaborative research environments, allowing me to refine my problem-solving and software development skills. I am deeply committed to continuous learning and innovation, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute meaningfully to the field of AI and software engineering.</p>
