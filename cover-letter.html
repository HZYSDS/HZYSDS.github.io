<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
<p>I am excited to apply for the Graduate Engineer position at Industrus Engineering. With a Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) in Software Engineering from UTS, specialized expertise in AI-driven systems, deep learning, and thermal imaging, I am eager to contribute to your pioneering AI and engineering projects, such as Australia's largest lithium-ion battery initiative and innovative infrastructure solutions.</p>
<p>A commitment to ethical conduct and the highest standards of professional accountability
Situation: During my research at UTS's MultiVideo Lab, our high-precision FLIR FC-608 thermal camera initially produced inconsistent data, threatening the reliability of our pedestrian and vehicle segmentation analysis.
Task: As the primary responsible researcher, my role was to diagnose and rectify this critical issue.
Action: After meticulous calibration testing, I identified a calibration discrepancy. Aware of the ethical implications, I immediately reported this to my supervisor and suggested necessary recalibration steps.
Result: These corrective measures significantly enhanced our segmentation accuracy, increasing reliability from approximately 70% to 89%, ensuring research integrity.</p>
<p>Demonstrated ability to effectively communicate both with other engineers and with stakeholders from different fields
Situation: Developing an intelligent infrared monitoring system required alignment between software engineers and local community stakeholders.
Task: I was responsible for facilitating clear, effective communication to align technical outcomes with stakeholder expectations.
Action: I organized regular stakeholder meetings, translating complex AI and thermal imaging concepts into accessible language and visual presentations.
Result: Effective communication improved stakeholder understanding, accelerated decision-making processes, and ensured timely project delivery, significantly increasing stakeholder satisfaction.</p>
<p>The ability to engage with a creative, innovative, and proactive environment
Situation: At the Global Big Data Technology Centre, inefficiencies in generating comparative descriptors for vision-language CLIP models slowed research progress.
Task: Recognizing the need for innovation, I took the initiative to streamline this critical research workflow.
Action: I developed an automated API batching system, significantly reducing the manual effort required in descriptor generation.
Result: This innovative solution boosted workflow efficiency by approximately 30%, facilitating faster experimentation cycles and enhancing research productivity.</p>
<p>Demonstrated ability to use and manage information
Situation: For my capstone project using Segment Anything (SAM) for real-time thermal image segmentation, extensive data management was essential.
Task: My role required robust collection, organization, and analysis of large-scale thermal video datasets.
Action: I created structured data repositories and standardized data preprocessing workflows to ensure data integrity and accessibility.
Result: This systematic approach led to a 40% reduction in preprocessing errors, enabling accurate real-time segmentation, critical to project success.</p>
<p>The ability to manage your own performance in a professional environment
Situation: During my internship at Codnoy Technology, initially, I faced challenges in confidently handling complex backend software development tasks.
Task: I recognized the need to actively improve my professional skills and confidence.
Action: I proactively sought mentorship, undertook additional training, and gradually increased my responsibilities in critical backend framework development and API design.
Result: My proactive learning resulted in successfully delivering several key APIs, earning recognition from management as an 'Excellent Developer'.</p>
<p>A demonstrated ability to work as part of a team and to show leadership when required
Situation: While developing an AI-based mobile waste-classification app, our team faced significant resource constraints and tight deadlines.
Task: Identifying the risk of delay, I took the initiative to assume a leadership role.
Action: I organized structured team meetings, clearly allocated tasks, and utilized tools such as Trello for project tracking and accountability.
Result: This proactive leadership ensured timely project completion and strengthened overall team collaboration and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to further discuss how my background in AI-driven systems and commitment to innovation can contribute positively to Industrus Engineering’s visionary projects.
